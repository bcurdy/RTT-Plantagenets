<p>
Plantagenet is a board wargame about the Wars of the Roses.
It covers the main periods of military conflict between the Plantagenet dynasty's royal houses of Lancaster and York. 

<p>
Players will create and maintain a network of allied lords and nobles in order
to obtain the provender and coin needed to supply and pay their armies. As
ravaging and looting will damage each side's reputation, each faction will
strive to convince cites to join its side. Great battles will seek to kill or
capture enemy lords—perhaps even a king. Two kinds of operational moves will be
in play: the military and the political.

<p>
In the end, when the dust settles and all arrows have flown, one rose will sit
on the throne. White or Red, York or Lancaster, gather your troops and banners
and join the fight.
