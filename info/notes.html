Plantagenet: Implementation Notes
</h1>

<hr>

<p>

Sequence of play changes for expediency:

<ul>

<li>One side does all Pay steps before next side.
<li>One side does all of Feed, Pillage and Disband before next side.
<li>The King side Feeds first after their command card.
<li>You cannot play <i>Parliament's Truce</i> after the enemy has declared an interception.
</ul>

<hr>

<p>
Other minor rules changes:

<ul>
<li>You cannot Intercept a locale which has enemy non-moving Lords.
<li><i>Suspicion</i> counts printed influence, not modified.
<li><i>Caltrops</i> is attached to a friendly Lord.
</ul>
